## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

CSS Filter: 


```css
.icon:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
    filter: invert(60%) sepia(90%) saturate(2000%) hue-rotate(255deg) brightness(94%) contrast(95%);
} 
```


### Continued development

CSS is an enigma but it rewards the brave, especially when you just found the solution to a styling issue. This project allows you to relax and concentrate on the little details that make css awesome. Ill keep working to understand parts of the technology as its especially useful for my career.
